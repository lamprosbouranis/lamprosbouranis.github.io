Welcome to my personal website! 

I am currently a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Research Fellow at the [Department of Statistics](https://www.dept.aueb.gr/en/stat), Athens University of Economics and Business. My research focuses on Bayesian inference and model selection for stochastic epidemics under the supervision of [Prof. Nikos Demiris](http://www2.aueb.gr/users/nikos/) and [Prof. Ioannis Ntzoufras](https://www.aueb.gr/en/faculty_page/ntzoufras-ioannis/).

I obtained my PhD in Statistics at [University College Dublin](http://www.ucd.ie/) under the supervision of [Prof. Nial Friel](https://maths.ucd.ie/~nial/) and the mentoring of [Dr. Florian Maire](https://maths.ucd.ie/~fmaire/). My research project was funded by the [Insight Centre for Data Analytics](http://www.insight-centre.org/) and the main focus lied on the Bayesian analysis of intractable likelihoods with applications to Gibbs random fields.

My full CV is available [here](Bouranis_CV.pdf) [last update: 15/10/2021].
