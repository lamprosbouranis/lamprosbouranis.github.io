Welcome to my personal website! 

I am currently a Statistician - Consultant at Accenture Greece. I obtained my PhD in Statistics at [University College Dublin](http://www.ucd.ie/) under the supervision of [Prof. Nial Friel](https://maths.ucd.ie/~nial/) and the mentoring of [Dr. Florian Maire](https://maths.ucd.ie/~fmaire/). My research project was funded by the [Insight Centre for Data Analytics](http://www.insight-centre.org/) and the main focus lied on the Bayesian analysis of intractable likelihoods with applications to Gibbs random fields.

My full CV is available [here](Bouranis_CV.pdf) [last update: 24/11/2019].
