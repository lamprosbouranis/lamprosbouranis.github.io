The Bergm package for R provides a comprehensive framework for Bayesian parameter estimation and model selection for exponential random graph models using various algorithms. It can also supply graphical Bayesian goodness-of-fit procedures that address the issue of model adequacy. See also Alberto Caimo's [webpage](https://acaimo.github.io).
